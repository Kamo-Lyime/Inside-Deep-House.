                         blissfully jazzy & vocal Detroit House guides to paradise class deep vibes where late Nite Mediterranean meets Chicago auras arise.</p>
                        
                        <p>Melchior Sultana (Malta) introduces the Bside of the ride with instant club magic, remixing A1 in his own elegant & Profound way, followed by Dan Piu traversing the mind and ears through introspective Detroit Techno with soul permeating atmosphere, leading to the conclusion of this tour de force as He and Roger Versey (Ozarks,Arkansas) arrive as Passport bringing an eclectic collage of arcade funk sensibilities and warm analogue House to the occasion for the deeper persuasion. They say there is no genre, just the essence…Welcome and enjoy,

<p>Corona Extra Mexican Lager Import Beer, 12 pk 12 fl oz Bottles, 4.6% ABV</p>
<p>Corona Extra Mexican Lager Beer is an even-keeled cerveza with fruity-honey aromas and a touch of malt. 
  This bottled beer 12 pack is a great tailgating beer, beach drink, or barbecue beverage.</P>
  <p><img class="img-logo " src="Images/Bev/logo.jpg" alt=""></p></strong></p>
     <p>Our Origin Story - 
      Corona beer’s international expansion began in the South and Southwestern regions of the US — with American tourists returning from Mexico bringing a taste for the beer they’d enjoyed on the sunny beaches of Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta home with them.</P>
       <p>A Taste of the Sun - 
        In 1979, Corona Extra was introduced in the U.S. and quickly became synonymous with the American beach and barbecue lifestyle.</p>
       <p>In the late ‘80s, people started asking for a more calorie-conscious beer that didn’t skimp on taste — and we listened. 
        Corona Light was introduced to U.S. customers in 1989, and you probably know the rest.</p>
       <p>A New Generation - 
        Recently, we’ve added a few new drinks to kick back with, to give more choices for everyone who’s already living La Vida Más Fina. 
        We started with Corona Premier, our lower-carb, lower-calorie*, and smoother-taste option.</p>
        <p>From there, we debuted Corona Seltzer, our take on the undeniable appeal of spiked seltzer, and Corona Refresca, a light and sweet (but not *too* sweet) ABA product for a different category of beer drinkers.
          Of course, our story doesn’t end here — we’re just getting started.</p>
